HOW SUCCESS FACTORS EVOLVED 2018-2023     \n\n\n                            Yelp Open Dataset Analysis                          \n\n\n                            Data Science Final Project                          \n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nRESEARCH QUESTION:\n\n\nHow did the predictors of restaurant success change during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\nThis analysis examines whether operational flexibility (delivery, takeout) became\n\n\nmore important for restaurant ratings during 2020-2023 compared to pre-pandemic.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\n\nUsing Yelp review data spanning 2018-2023, we compare regression coefficient\n\n\nestimates across three distinct time periods to identify shifting success factors.\n\n\nKey variables include price range, delivery availability, takeout options, and\n\n\nrestaurant category performance.\n\n\nüìä DATASET OVERVIEW:\n\n\n=====================\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Total reviews analyzed: 10,000\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Unique restaurants: 500\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Average rating: 3.81 stars (SD = 0.60)\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Date range: 2018-01-01 to 2023-12-31\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Restaurant categories: 6\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Restaurants with delivery: 39.2%\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Restaurants with takeout: 70.6%\n\n\nFIGURE 1: Restaurant Success Predictors Across Time Periods\n\n\n============================================================\n\n\nThis coefficient plot shows how different factors predict restaurant ratings\n\n\nacross three time periods. Points represent coefficient estimates with 95%\n\n\nconfidence intervals. Values above zero indicate positive effects on ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 2: Restaurant Rating Trends Over Time\n\n\n=============================================\n\n\nMonthly average ratings showing the impact of COVID-19 on restaurant\n\n\nperformance.

OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY BECAME CRITICAL DURING COVID-19\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Delivery coefficient increased by 192% during COVID era\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Takeout coefficient increased by 460% during COVID era\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Restaurants without these services experienced significant rating declines\n\n\n2. PRICE SENSITIVITY INTENSIFIED DURING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Price coefficient became more negative during COVID (-0.15 vs -0.08 pre-COVID)\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Budget-friendly restaurants showed greater resilience\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Premium pricing without delivery/takeout was particularly penalized\n\n\n3. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE PATTERNS EMERGED\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Fast Food ratings improved by +-0.016 stars during the analysis period\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Traditional dining categories showed increased volatility\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Quick-service models proved more adaptable to restrictions\n\n\n4. REVIEW VOLUME EFFECTS STRENGTHENED POST-COVID\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Review volume coefficient increased from 0.15 to 0.18 post-COVID\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Online presence became increasingly important for success\n\n\n   ‚Ä¢ Digital engagement emerged as a key competitive advantage\n\n\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS:\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Dependent variable: Star rating (1-5 scale)\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Key predictors: Price, delivery, takeout, review volume\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Controls: Restaurant category, temporal trends\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Sample size: 10,000 reviews across 500 restaurants"

It assumes that the relationship between these factors (price, delivery availability, takeout availability, and review volume) and ratings stays constant over time. This model gives us a baseline understanding of what generally makes restaurants successful, but it doesn‚Äôt account for how these relationships might have changed during different periods like the COVID pandemic."
